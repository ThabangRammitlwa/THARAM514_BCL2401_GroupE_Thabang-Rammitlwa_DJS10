## Project Brief: DJS10 - Asynchrony

#### Objective
Dive into the asynchronous world of React by creating an application that fetches and displays blog posts from an API. You'll practice handling API calls with the Fetch API, managing application state, and gracefully handling errors.

#### Project Description
Your task is to build a React application that makes HTTP GET requests to the JSONPlaceholder API to retrieve a list of dummy blog posts. The application should render the titles and bodies of these posts on the screen. You'll also implement error handling to manage unsuccessful API calls.
 
 The project was a short and straight to a point challenge, all was needed was to show the ability to fetch an API and handle errors.
